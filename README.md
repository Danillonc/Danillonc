# Danillo Coradello - @Danillonc ðŸ‘‹
  I'm a Java developer working on JavaEE plataform since 2011 and year by year I've been studying a lot of languages in tech world. I've worked with frontend libs React/Angular but now I'm back to backend again the darkside of power!!! 
  Almost a year I've discovered Kotlin and I need to say for everyone that is incredible language.
  
# How I work actually
  Now I've been working in microservices archtectures as backend developer with Java and Kotlin. I'am a Software Engineer at Banco Votorantim developing APIs.
